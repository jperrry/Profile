# 📝 Project Overview

I completed a personal hardware repair project where I replaced a damaged MacBook display. I sourced a compatible replacement screen online, disassembled the laptop, and installed the new screen, restoring the device to full working condition.

**Key aspects:**

- Hands-on experience with laptop hardware repair
- Careful handling of sensitive internal components
- Independent problem-solving to identify, source, and fit the correct replacement part

This project demonstrates my ability to carry out precise hardware repairs and approach technical problems with a methodical, detail-oriented mindset.

6. **Removing the Wi-Fi Vent Module**
    
    - The **Wi-Fi vent module is glued down** and needs to be carefully peeled off.
