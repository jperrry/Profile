# üìù Project Overview

This project was the foundation for many of my later builds and experiments. It wasn‚Äôt an especially unique configuration, but it was my first full hardware rebuild in years and helped me get back into hands-on component work.

My original PC was built in ~2015 through a local computer store, MSY, with a friend‚Äôs input. Looking back years later, the build was actually well-balanced for its time ‚Äî a modest setup that reliably handled gaming and everyday workloads. Its most notable component was the **NVIDIA GTX 1080**, which I decided to carry forward into the rebuild given its ongoing performance and the inflated GPU market at the time.

Throughout mid-to-late 2024 I gradually replaced parts, aiming to balance performance, cost, and some degree of future proofing (with the occasional case of ‚Äúoverkill‚Äù in RAM and storage). My focus was on building a **versatile workstation** ‚Äî something capable of handling security labs, virtualization, productivity, and light gaming without being limited by hardware bottlenecks.

**Key upgrades included:**

- **CPU**: Switched from Intel to **AMD Ryzen 9 5900X (12-core / 24-thread)** for strong multi-core performance and long-term value.
- **RAM**: Upgraded from 16GB to **64GB DDR4** (jumped past 32GB due to minimal price difference at the time).
- **Storage**: Upgraded from smaller SSDs to a **2TB NVMe M.2 SSD**, with existing HDDs repurposed for bulk storage.
- **Motherboard**: Replaced with a Wi-Fi capable model (despite mixed reviews due to discontinued support).
- **Carried over**: GTX 1080 GPU, PSU, and HDDs.

The end result is a PC optimized for multitasking, virtualization, and research projects, with enough headroom for future experimentation. While I may have gone beyond what was strictly necessary, the system provides a reliable platform for both professional and personal projects.

### Security Considerations

Although primarily a performance-focused rebuild, I also factored in several security aspects:

- **Firmware & BIOS updates** applied to reduce exposure to hardware-level vulnerabilities.
- **TPM and Secure Boot** enabled during setup to support disk encryption and OS integrity verification.
- **Drive sanitization** of reused HDDs prior to migration to prevent data leakage.
- **OS and hypervisor hardening** planned for use cases involving virtualization and lab environments.
- **Minimal driver footprint** to reduce attack surface, especially since the motherboard had mixed support.

These measures ensure the workstation isn‚Äôt just powerful, but also hardened against common hardware and firmware-based attack vectors.
