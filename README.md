I am a soon-to-be Deakin Bachelor of Cyber Security graduate with a profound interest in penetration testing and a dedication to solving complex problems. With prior studies and a background in Psychological Science, throughout my studies I've been facinated by the recurring Social Engineering vulnerabilites idetified throughout the cybersecurity field. 

## Objective

Graduating with my bachelors in cybersecurity early next year, Iâ€™m eager to enter the industry in a position where I can both continue leanring and begin applying my skills to make making meaningful contributions. With a minor in business management and background in psychology I have valuable communication skills allowing me to work efficiently on independant and collaborative projects. With a vested interest and a strong foundational knowledge of technical processes, I'm a fast learner, able to easily adapte to my environment.
